# Quotes on Dev Starter

A WordPress starter theme for the Quotes on Dev project, forked from Underscores.

Inspired by Quotes on Design, Quotes on Dev is a theme that uses ajax to query the wordpress api. Using GET and POST requests, Quotes on Dev dynamically loads a new quote without refreshing the page and updates the wordpress posts upon quote submission. For security purposes, a nonce is also implemented.
